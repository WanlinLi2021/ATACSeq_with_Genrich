This is a pepeline pf ATAC-seq analysis. The gidelines https://informatics.fas.harvard.edu/atac-seq-guidelines.html#peak were followed.

For the part of quantitative analysis, the Workshop https://github.com/bioinformatics-core-shared-training/Quantitative-ChIPseq-Workshop was followed.

This workflow used Genrich as the peak-caller.
